Data Exploration Tutorial

Overview

Welcome to this tutorial designed for beginners who want to learn data exploration using Python libraries such as Seaborn, Pandas, and Matplotlib. This guide will help you get comfortable with essential data analysis techniques and provide hands-on examples to start your journey in data exploration.

Datasets Used

1. Wine Quality Dataset

Description: The wine-quality.csv is a supervised dataset containing data about different wine samples and their quality ratings.

Supporting File: wine-quality.names

Content: This file includes important details like column names, data separators, and information about missing values.

Recommendation: It is highly advised to read the wine-quality.names file to fully understand the structure and content of the dataset.

2. Iris Dataset

Description: The Iris dataset is a classic dataset often used to teach basic machine learning algorithms and data exploration.

Supporting File: The .names file provides additional insights and details about the dataset's features and structure.

Recommendation: Review the .names file for crucial information that can help you during the data exploration phase, saving you time and ensuring you have accurate knowledge about the data.
